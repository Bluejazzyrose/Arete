## Arete
### Greek Mythology MMORPG

Date started: October 2024

The grand vision for Arete—named for the Greek word meaning excellence, integrity, or virtue—is an MMO game with two unique mechanics. First, unlike most MMOs, the player does not progress through the game via leveling, which is tedious and makes certain aspects of the game inaccessible until you have played for long enough. Second, each type of character the player can make has unique death mechanics; the player doesn’t just respawn at a specific place when they die. Visually, the game would be somewhat top-down, using a grid-like map structure, with small maps that the player can traverse seamlessly between.

Algorithm:
* Four unique race classes that the player can choose between, each with unique abilities and death mechanics, which are subclasses of a single parent class Player
* Many unique maps that the player can seamlessly traverse between
    * Different terrain types: squares that are blocked, aquatic spaces, outdoor spaces, etc., which do different things depending on the player’s character race.
    * Unique objects populate each map, which the player can interact with depending on the object type
